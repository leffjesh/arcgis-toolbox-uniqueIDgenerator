arcgis-toolbox-uniqueIDgenerator
================================

This is an ArcGIS python toolbox with a tool to create UUIDs for a specified layer in a specified attribute.  

Requirements:

You must have ArcGIS installed in order to use this.  Developed with ArcGIS 10.1 install.

Setup:

Download the *.pyt file.  To do this select the file in the github file tree.  Then you will see a "RAW" link above the document.  This is link to the raw document which you can save to your computer.  In ArcGIS right-click in ArcToolbox window and select "Add Toolbox".  Then navigate to the *.pyt file included in this repository and you will have access to this tool.  Be sure to download the "raw" .pyt file.

If you have difficulty, there is a good chance that others are as well.  Please send me a note at jlesh@conservationdistrict.org and I will add more details to the README to help avoid similar issues in the future.
